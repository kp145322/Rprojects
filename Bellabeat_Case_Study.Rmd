## Introduction and background
This is an R Markdown document with R script to view, process, clean, and analyze data for a Google data analytics certificate case study. I utilized CRAN packages 'tidyverse', 'here', 'skimr', 'janitor', and 'GGally'.  



## Business task
Analyze smart device usage data to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices and develop recommendations for Bellabeat products. For a summary of insights and recommendations, scroll to the bottom. 



## Data and limitations
This case study uses [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available by [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic) via Kaggle). This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty Fitbit users, generated by respondents to a survey distributed via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Variation in output represents use of different types of trackers and individual self-tracking behaviors and preferences.  

Notes on limitations:

* The dataset is not representative of the general U.S. population; sets are collected only from Fitbit users who voluntarily completed a survey. 

* Our sample size is too small to develop meaningful statistical predictions of consumer behavior. Instead, we will attempt to identify general trends and gain insight to guide further exploration and improve Bellabeat products. 



## Installing and loading the tidyverse package

```{r install and load packages}
# install.packages('tidyverse')
  library(tidyverse)
```



## Loading CSV files
Creates data frames for daily activity and sleep data. 

```{r import csv data}
daily_activity <- read.csv(
"~/CSV Data/fitbit data/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv")

sleep_day <- read.csv(
"~/CSV Data/fitbit data/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv")

weight_log <- read.csv(
"~/CSV Data/fitbit data/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
```



## Exploring key tables
View top rows of data frames.

```{r view data frames}
head(daily_activity)
head(sleep_day)
```


View column names.

```{r view column names}
colnames(daily_activity)
colnames(sleep_day)
```

Note: Both data sets contain 'Id' as a field. We can use this to merge the frames later.



## Viewing summary statistics for familiarization
How many unique participants are there in each dataframe? 

```{r distinct users}
n_distinct(daily_activity$Id)
n_distinct(sleep_day$Id)
```

Note: sleep_day has 24 unique 'Id' values but daily_activity has 33. This may indicate that some respondents chose not to submit, or don't record, sleep activity data. 


View the number of observations and summary statistics for each data frame. 

```{r observations in each data frame}
nrow(daily_activity)
nrow(sleep_day)
```


```{r activity summary statistics}
daily_activity %>%  
  select(TotalSteps,
         TotalDistance,
         SedentaryMinutes,
         Calories) %>% 
  summary() 
```

Notes:

* median steps for users are 7406

* There are a few low outliers with zero-values. Our data set description stated variations are due to user preferences and behaviors. Maybe the user forgot or chose not to wear the device, or maybe the device wasn't charged.


```{r sleep summary statistics}
sleep_day_v2 <- sleep_day %>% 
  mutate('TotalHoursAsleep' = TotalMinutesAsleep/60, 'TotalHoursInBed' = 
  TotalTimeInBed/60, .keep = "unused")

sleep_day_v2 %>%  
  select(TotalSleepRecords,
  TotalHoursAsleep,
  TotalHoursInBed) %>%
  summary()
```
Notes: 

* Converted time asleep and time in bed to hours to make values more intuitive. 

* Data indicates at least one respondent got <1 hour of sleep at least one night, another observation indicates a respondent spent over 16 hours in bed. These values deserve further investigation. 



## Cleaning our data
Calculate a new column for TotalMinutes to quickly see if users wore their charged device for the entire day. 

```{r create new variable for total minutes}
daily_activity_v2 <- daily_activity %>% 
  mutate(TotalMinutes = VeryActiveMinutes + FairlyActiveMinutes + 
  LightlyActiveMinutes + SedentaryMinutes)
```


```{r view total minutes summary}
daily_activity_v2 %>% 
  select(TotalMinutes) %>% 
  summary()
```

Note: Some observations appear to indicate a device was either not worn or not charged for the entire 24-hour (1440 minute) period. Run a filter for observations <= 2 hours of sleep  or <= 720 total minutes (half of one day) after combining data frames to see all associated values in one place. 



```{r install and load data cleaning packages}
# install.packages("here")
# install.packages("skimr")
# install.packages("janitor")

library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
```


View a more detailed data summary.
```{r detailed summary data}
skim_without_charts(daily_activity_v2)
skim_without_charts(sleep_day)
```

Notes:

* Daily_activity_v2 has one character-type variable, ActivityDate. The rest are numeric. 

* standard deviation for TotalSteps is almost as high as the mean value, and mean TotalMinutes is below 1440. 

* sleep_day_v2 has one character-type variable, 'SleepDay', which is actually a variable with combined date and time. Transform it to match the date format of of the daily activity frame before merging. 



## Merging data frames
```{r change variable names to match for data frame merge}
library(lubridate)

sleep_day_v3 <- sleep_day_v2 %>% 
  mutate(NewSleepDay = substr(sleep_day_v2$SleepDay, 1, 9))
```


```{r trim whitespace and remove redundant variables}
sleep_day_v3$ActivityDate <- trimws(sleep_day_v3$NewSleepDay, which = c("both"),
  whitespace = " ")

sleep_day_v4 <- sleep_day_v3 %>% 
  select(-NewSleepDay, -SleepDay) 
```


```{r merge data frames}
sleep_and_activity <- full_join(daily_activity_v2, sleep_day_v4, all = TRUE)
```


Some of the values in sleep_and_activity have SedentaryMinutes values of 1440 minutes, a value for calories, and no other data. I assume these values represent days where Fitbits collected data but were not worn by users, resulting in a basal metabolic rate caloric calculation and a reading of 'sedentary' for the entire 24 hours. I will remove these observations to clean the data set. 

```{r filter out observations where Fitbit not used}
sleep_and_activity_v2 <- filter(sleep_and_activity, SedentaryMinutes!=1440)
```


```{r filter to observe outliers}
low_outliers <- sleep_and_activity_v2 %>% 
  filter(TotalHoursAsleep <= 2 | TotalMinutes <= 720) 
head(low_outliers)
```

Note: There are a few values where TotalMinutes are less than 60 and the associated calorie count is high. This might be indicative of users who wore their Fitbit only for the duration of a single workout that day. The vast majority of observations seem to indicate that our survey respondents are wearing their Fitbits for long duration and consistently, rather than using them to track isolated workouts. 


Let's explore this idea:

```{r percentage of observations where Fitbit worn more than half the day}
(nrow(sleep_and_activity_v2[sleep_and_activity_v2$TotalMinutes > 720, ])/ 
   nrow(sleep_and_activity_v2)) * 100
```

Notes: 

* Respondents used their Fitbits for *more than half the day in 97% of reported observations.* 

* These users may benefit from a combined subscription service and app with a dashboard for viewing and managing data and receiving health recommendations. 

* Performing additional surveys with questions about user behavior could expand this insight.  


```{r add a new variable for total active minutes}
sleep_and_activity_v3 <- sleep_and_activity_v2 %>% mutate(TotalActiveMinutes = 
  VeryActiveMinutes + FairlyActiveMinutes + LightlyActiveMinutes)
```



## Plotting explorations and analysis

```{r convert sleep times back into minutes for better graphical comparison}
sleep_and_activity_v4 <- sleep_and_activity_v3 %>% 
  mutate('TotalMinutesAsleep' = TotalHoursAsleep*60, 'TotalMinutesInBed' = 
  TotalHoursInBed*60, .keep = "unused")
```


```{r create corellogram for quick comparison}

# install.packages("GGally")
library(GGally)

segment_sleep_steps_activity <- sleep_and_activity_v4 %>% select(TotalSteps, 
  TotalActiveMinutes, TotalMinutesAsleep, SedentaryMinutes)

ggpairs(
  segment_sleep_steps_activity,
  title = 'Correlation Matrix',
  axisLabels = c("show"),
  labeller = "label_value",
  proportions = "auto",
  shape = ".",
  cardinality_threshold = NULL
  ) + theme_minimal()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 
```

Notes:

* Correlation values are Pearson correlation coefficients

* TotalSteps and TotalActiveMinutes are positively correlated.

* TotalMinutesAsleep and SedentaryMinutes are negatively correlated. This means that as time spent sedentary goes up time spent sleeping generally goes down, but it does not prove causation.



Focus on the two strongest correlations among the analyzed variables.  

```{r plot TotalSteps and TotalActiveMinutes}
sleep_and_activity_v4 %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=TotalActiveMinutes, y=TotalSteps)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE) + theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title="Fitbit Data: Active Minutes vs. Total Steps", subtitle=
      "Sample of 30 Users", caption =
      "Data collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk 03.12.2016-05.12.2016") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), plot.subtitle = 
        element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


```{r plot sedentary minutes and minutes asleep}
sleep_and_activity_v4 %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=SedentaryMinutes, y=TotalMinutesAsleep)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE) + theme_minimal() +  
  labs(title="Fitbit Data: Sedentary Minutes vs. Minutes Asleep", subtitle=
  "Sample of 30 Users",
  caption="Data collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk 03.12.2016-05.12.2016")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), plot.subtitle = 
  element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


Observe the relationship between sedentary time, sleep time, and BMI for respondents after merging in the weight_log data frame. 

```{r merge weight_log}
bmi_data <- weight_log %>%  
  group_by(Id) %>% 
  summarize(BMI = mean(BMI))

activity_bmi_sleep <- full_join(sleep_and_activity_v4, bmi_data)

unique_id_bmi <- activity_bmi_sleep %>%  
  select(Id, BMI, SedentaryMinutes) %>% 
  group_by(Id) %>% 
  summarize(user_bmi = mean(BMI), user_sedentary_minutes = mean(SedentaryMinutes)) %>% 
  na.omit()
  
unique_id_bmi %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=user_sedentary_minutes, y=user_bmi, 
                                    size=user_bmi)) +theme_minimal() +
  labs(title="Fitbit Users: Sedentary Minutes vs. BMI", subtitle=
  "Sample of 8 Users",
  caption="Data collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk 03.12.2016-05.12.2016") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), plot.subtitle = 
  element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Note: It turns out there are only 8 unique Id's with corresponding BMI values in the survey results. This sample is probably too small to gain meaningful insight. 

Earlier analysis indicated users wore devices for 720 or more minutes out of 1440 minutes in 97% of our survey observations. Expand that idea with a histogram counting unique user Ids per bin, where bins group mean daily Fitbit utilization proportion values.

```{r}
use_data_histogram <- activity_bmi_sleep %>%  
  select(Id, TotalMinutes, TotalActiveMinutes) %>% 
  group_by(Id) %>% 
  summarize(fitbit_use_ratio = mean(TotalMinutes)/1440, 
  mean_active_minutes = mean(TotalActiveMinutes))

ggplot(data=use_data_histogram) + geom_histogram(mapping=aes
  (x=fitbit_use_ratio), binwidth = 0.2) + expand_limits(x=0) + 
  theme_minimal() + labs(title=
  "Histogram: User Count per fitbit_use_ratio", 
  subtitle="33 users sampled, ratio = TotalMinutes / Day",
  caption="Data collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk 03.12.2016-05.12.2016") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), plot.subtitle = 
  element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Note: The majority of survey respondents used their Fitbits for more than half the day, so the trend *among those surveyed* is to regularly and consistently wear their Fitbits and maintain them charged. 



## Summary of insights

* Total steps and total active minutes are relatively strongly correlated. It makes sense that someone who walks more would spend more minutes being active and vice versa, but this correlation does not prove causation and there may be a confounding variable affecting both values. Total active minutes includes lightly active, fairly active, and very active minutes. 

* Sedentary minutes and sleep time are negatively correlated. This does not prove causation, but we can create hypotheses to test for a causal relationship. Possible hypotheses include: 

  1) People who spend more time sedentary spend less time active because the lack of physical activity induces physiological changes resulting
  in less sleep.

  2) People who sleep less feel less energetic and are therefore less motivated to perform physical activity, resulting in reduced daily active     minutes.

* Surveyed users utilize their Fitbits consistently throughout the day and regularly across days. Note this data is collected from voluntary survey participants so our sample may be biased towards users who use their Fitbits regularly.

## Recommendations and next steps

* Conduct surveys with a larger and more representative sample of Fitbit and other fitness tracking device users. Use these results to inform business development; for example, if most users regularly track their data, adding features to the Bellabeat app and online fitness tracking subscription service and marketing them to these users may result in higher subscription rates.

* Survey Bellabeat users to see what features they would like to see in the subscription service, and how their preferences compare to present services.

* Validate the correlation between sedentary time and reduced sleep time through further exploration. If it holds true, we can use the correlation to target Bellabeat ads, using Google search and social media history, to people who want to get more sleep. In this case, we would focus on the correlation between more steps and more sleep in ads, and relate how the Bellabeat Leaf and mobile app help users track, analyze, and raise their step count.  

* Survey Bellabeat users to determine the rise in step count for new users of the Bellabeat Leaf and online subscription, then advertise this result in conjunction with the correlation between sedentary time and reduced sleep time.
